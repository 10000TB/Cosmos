# Cosmos version history

## 1.2.0 (2016-02-20)

* Added border for filled star (before the color of the border and the filling were the same for the filled star).
* Renamed color and border properties to make them start with words 'Empty' and 'Filled'. This is done to distinguish the fields visually in the attributes inspector. Attribute inspector shows only the start of a long name filling the rest with "dot, dot, dot". For example, field names  "Border color empty" and "Border color filled" both looked like "Border color..." and it was impossible to tell which one is which. Now they look like "Filled border..." and "Empty border...".

  The field were renames the following way (old -> new):

  * borderColorEmpty -> emptyBorderColor
  * borderWidthEmpty -> emptyBorderWidth
  * colorEmpty -> emptyColor
  * colorFilled -> filledColor


## 1.1.4 (2015-11-25)

* @staticdreams added tvOS support.


## 1.1.3 (2015-11-09)

* Added `didFinishTouchingCosmos` property.
* Moved repository from https://github.com/exchangegroup/Cosmos to https://github.com/marketplacer/Cosmos.

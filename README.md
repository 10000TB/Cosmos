## Setup

There are three ways you can add Cosmos to your Xcode project.

**Add source (iOS 7+)**

Simply add [CosmosDistrib.swift](https://github.com/exchangegroup/Cosmos/edit/master/Distrib/CosmosDistrib.swift) file into your Xcode project.

**Setup with Carthage (iOS 8+)**

Alternatively, add `github "exchangegroup/Cosmos" ~> 1.0` to your Cartfile and run `carthage update`.

**Setup with CocoaPods (iOS 8+)**

If you are using CocoaPods add this text to your Podfile and run `pod install`.

    use_frameworks!
    pod 'Cosmos', '~> 1.0'

## Usage

1. Add `import Cosmos` to your source code if you used Carthage or CocoaPods setup methods.

2. Add `View` control into your storyboard. Set its class to `CosmosView`. Set its *module* property to `Cosmos` if you did Carthage or CocoaPods setup.

1. Add an outlet for this view in your view controller.
1. Use `show` method to display rating:

```
ratingView.show(rating: 4, text: "(132)")
```

## Customization

Customization can be made by changing `settings` properties. For example:

```
ratingView.settings.starColorFilled = UIColor.blackColor()
ratingView.settings.starFillMode = TegStarFillMode.Precise
```

This project includes a demo iOS app.

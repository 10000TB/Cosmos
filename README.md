<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exchangegroup/Cosmos/master/graphics/Screenshots/star_screenshot_dark.png' alt='Star raiting control for iOS / Swift' width='300'>

This is a UI control for iOS for showing a 5-star rating or taking the rating input from the user. Cosmos is a subclass of a UIView.

* Shows star rating with an optional text label.
* Can be used as a rating input control.
* Cosmos view can be customized in the Storyboard without writing code.
* Includes different star filling modes: full, half-filled and precise.

## Setup

There are three ways you can add Cosmos to your Xcode project.

**Add source (iOS 7+)**

Simply add [CosmosDistrib.swift](https://github.com/exchangegroup/Cosmos/edit/master/Distrib/CosmosDistrib.swift) file into your Xcode project.

**Setup with Carthage (iOS 8+)**

Alternatively, add `github "exchangegroup/Cosmos" ~> 1.0` to your Cartfile and run `carthage update`.

**Setup with CocoaPods (iOS 8+)**

If you are using CocoaPods add this text to your Podfile and run `pod install`.

    use_frameworks!
    pod 'Cosmos', '~> 1.0'

## Usage

1. Add `import Cosmos` to your source code if you used Carthage or CocoaPods setup methods.

2. Add `View` control into your storyboard. Set its class to `CosmosView` in the *identity inspector*. Set its *module* property to `Cosmos` if you did Carthage or CocoaPods setup.

3. Customize the Cosmos view appearance in the *attributes inspector*.

## Using Cosmos in code

You can also style and control the Cosmos view from your code by creating an outlet in your view controller or by creating a new instance of `CosmosView` class.

```Swift
// Change the cosmos view rating
view.rating = 4

// Change the text
view.text = "(123)"

// Receive user input
view.didTouchCosmos = { rating in }
```


## Customization

One can customize Cosmos from code by changing its `settings`. See the [Cosmos configuration manual](https://github.com/exchangegroup/Cosmos/wiki/Cosmos-configuration) for the complete list of configuration options.

```Swift
// Show only fully filled stars
view.settings.fillMode = .Full

// Change the size of the stars
view.settings.starSize = 30

// Set the distance between stars
view.settings.starMargin = 5

// Set the color of a filled star
view.settings.colorFilled = UIColor.orangeColor()

// Set the border color of an empty star
view.settings.borderColorEmpty = UIColor.orangeColor()

// Change the rating when the view is touched
view.settings.updateOnTouch = true
```

## Usage

1. Copy .swift files under `start-rating-view` group into your project.
1. Add `View` control into your storyboard. Set its class to `TegStarRatingView`.
1. Add an outlet for this view in your view controller.
1. Use `show` method to display rating:

```
ratingView.show(rating: 4, text: "(132)")
```

## Customization

Customization can be made by changing `settings` properties. For example:

```
ratingView.settings.starColorFilled = UIColor.blackColor()
ratingView.settings.starFillMode = TegStarFillMode.Precise
```
